#if the cloud-config server is down, 
#then the client will throw an error not during startup, 
#but while trying to access a property at runtime. 
#To avoid this we can have the failFast property set to true. 
#By this the client will fail at startup time rather than at run time.

# if we add basic authentication for cloud config, we need to add username/password for all
# 4 microservices like below , instead of above
